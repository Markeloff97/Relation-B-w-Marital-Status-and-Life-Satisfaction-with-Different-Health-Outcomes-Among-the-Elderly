# Relation-B-w-Marital-Status-and-Life-Satisfaction-with-Different-Health-Outcomes-Among-the-Elderly

**Background:** According previous studies and analysis, it has been discovered that less 
depression is correlated with high marital output. Single adults, however, have better mental 
health effects than individuals who are unhappily married/ Divorced/Widowed.

**Aim:** The purpose of this study was to explore the link between elderly people's marital status,
feeling of depression and loneliness, any self reported long term illness and self rated health; to 
examine whether marital status is a health risk factor. Variables like gender and age were used 
to support this study.

**Methods:** This study is done using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA
Wave 7). To test if marital status is statistically correlated with health effects such as depression 
and loneliness, the Chi-square test was used. To assess the risk factors for the welfare of older 
people, Binary Logistic Regression model is used.
